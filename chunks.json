    "To view this email as a web page, go here. Dear Trojan Family, We are excited to start a new academic year and welcome our new and returning students, faculty, staff, and alumni to campus. It's a wonderful time to renew and create new relationships, explore something different, and set fresh goals. We have a very busy term ahead, with new academic programs, events around joining the Big Ten, marquee student performances, research breakthroughs, and so much more. We hope you had a refreshing summer and look forward to seeing you. Over the summer we tightened and expanded our rules and processes designed to ensure our campus is safe and welcoming for everyone. A list of links to this critical information is included below. One thing you\u2019ll notice immediately is the improved process of accessing campus. We hope the new system will make it faster and easier. Last Spring's Challenges: The events of last spring were particularly challenging for campuses nationwide. USC has seen peaceful protests, vigils, and marches for years, including more than 130 last year alone. However, the spring semester brought incidents that tested our values, disregarded our policies, sparked fears, and required unprecedented safety measures. While many in our community were not directly involved in the protests, we recognize the genuine pain and frustration driving them. This suffering and passion did not disappear over the summer. We hope by making our policies, guidelines, and rules clearer, we can make USC welcoming and safe for all, no matter what issues or conflicts arise. Free Expression and Academic Freedom: The ability to express oneself, to assert beliefs, and to dissent is fundamental to our university and our democracy. We each share a responsibility to foster an environment where divergent ideas can be discussed, examined, and challenged without infringing on others\u2019 rights and safety. As we transition to the fall semester, we remain committed to ensuring your rights to free speech, academic freedom, and peaceful protest in accordance with state and federal law. We expect you to follow the university\u2019s rules and policies designed to support your rights and prevent disruption of university functions. We also are required by law to maintain a safe and bias-free environment in our classrooms, hospitals, events, and campuses. These values are essential to the Trojan community and do not conflict with free speech or academic freedom. The links below explain free expression and academic freedom, along with legal responsibilities and limitations. Time, Place, and Manner Rules for Free Expression at USC: USC has long-standing rules, guided by federal and state law, to ensure that everyone can participate fully in a bias-free, free speech academic and on-campus residential environment. These \u201ctime, place, and manner\u201d limitations balance your right to express yourselves with the university\u2019s responsibility to ensure the rights of all. These include long-standing rules banning encampments, damaging property, blocking access to campus and classrooms, doxing, harassment, and bullying (online or in person), as well as clear guidelines for protests of all sorts. Over the summer, we reviewed and clarified these policies. You should become familiar with this material, and the Student Commitment which all students were required to read and acknowledge before enrolling. The university will continue to enforce these rules fairly, consistently, and expeditiously, acting quickly to protect campus health and safety. It always has been a Trojan Family value to be patient and respectful even in heated debates. By adhering to our highest standards, we will continue to maintain a culture of respect and dignity toward others. University Statements, Communication, and Accountability: Universities and their leaders often are asked to take sides on political, social, and moral issues. Yet, such statements can silence people, be seen as speaking for everyone, and lead to unintended consequences and seeming orthodoxies that stifle people\u2019s rights of free speech. This runs counter to our responsibility to support viewpoint diversity, open and impartial debate, free speech, and safety in all aspects of university life. This understanding drove the Unifying Values written and adopted by the USC community in 2020, which include \u201cfostering a community in which we solicit, embrace, and share diverse viewpoints.\u201d In line with these ideas, going forward as individual leaders or on behalf of the university, we will not post statements or take sides in political or social debates unless it pertains directly to our institutional mission and operations. This posture, sometimes referred to as \u201cinstitutional restraint or neutrality,\u201d has been widely adopted by both public and private universities across America. Trojans Care for Trojans: Global conflicts, along with social and political unrest or transition, always prompt strong reactions and feelings at universities. We embrace our societal role and encourage Trojans to safely and freely express themselves. At the same time, we call on you to care for your fellow Trojans even if you strongly disagree on issues. Let\u2019s embrace the expression \u201cTrojans Care for Trojans.\u201d By working together, we can create a university home for our Trojan Family that values differing opinions, cultivates open dialogue, supports one another, and seeks common ground in a complex world. We look forward to a great year with you. Fight On! Carol L. Folt President Robert C.

An entry in the log is intended only to provide timely, transparent information to the campus community about reported incidents on or near campus so that community members can make informed safety decisions. It is important to note that, in some cases, there may be a gap between when an event occurred and when it was reported to DPS. It takes time to investigate these reports thoroughly and fairly, and we urge the USC community to respect legal and university processes. Do not target or threaten an individual or groups of individuals based on an incident summary or association with locations where a reported incident may have occurred.

These past few weeks have been incredibly difficult for many members of our community. I hope you found time for yourselves and were able to get some much-needed rest. With classes back in full session, our campuses again are brimming with people and activity. Yet, like many of you, I realize that I am passing students, staff, faculty, and visitors who have family members and friends being directly impacted by violence taking place in several regions of the world. Our hearts go out to them. For many, the pain and fear for loved ones make concentrating very hard, and concerns about their own safety and fears of retaliation are ever present. More than ever, a gentle and kind approach to each other is needed \u2013 a recognition of the humanity we all share and the ties that bind us. Showing our compassion and being aware that none of us knows the full extent of what others are experiencing or feeling is a big step we each can take. In the coming days, we will continue to provide service and support systems for everyone. We continue to supplement our mental health and public safety teams. USC is a unique and extraordinary community. With close to 80,000 Trojans on our campuses, hospitals, and clinics, and more than 480,000 alumni \u2013 Trojans come from every state, more than 150 countries, and from virtually every culture, religion, walk of life, and perspective. Our diverse and beautiful community is our most special gift. We learn from and are enriched by each other; our bonds are lifelong and worldwide. As we have in the past, by drawing upon our extraordinary family and our humanity, we can make USC a respite of compassion and kindness. Trojans always care for Trojans.

As your president, my responsibility is to uphold our Trojan values so that everyone who lives, learns, and works here can have safe places to live, learn, and speak.This week, Alumni Park became unsafe. No one wants to have people arrested on their campus. Ever. But, when long-standing safety policies are flagrantly violated, buildings vandalized, DPS directives repeatedly ignored, threatening language shouted, people assaulted, and access to critical academic buildings blocked, we must act immediately to protect our community.USC has long-standing protocols that allow for peaceful protesting, and we have been working successfully with our community to ensure these rules have been followed at gatherings, protests, and vigils taking place all year. USC also has firm rules regarding harassment and bullying that we will uphold. If you have a concern, please report it here. I assure you we will launch an inquiry and take action to protect all USC students, faculty, and staff \u2013 no matter their views.The current pressures and polarization have taken a toll in ways that break my heart. I know Trojans will do what they have always done: share points of view, listen, search for common ground \u2013 and find ways to support each other. As students prepare for finals and our graduates look forward to celebrating their achievements at commencement \u2013 which we will do in just two weeks \u2013 we remain focused on what commencement means for all our graduates. This is especially true for our seniors who did not have a high school graduation and spent their first university year online. Many of you have been on this journey together \u2013 from new student convocation to USC\u2019s 141st commencement \u2013 for four years. Still others, like many of our graduate students, have shared even more years together. Many more faculty and staff have been working side-by-side with their colleagues throughout decades of service to our university.We are working around the clock to infuse this special day with new activities, surprises, and celebrations, while upholding traditions that are uniquely USC.I know every Trojan will continue to bring their best selves to meet this moment.

Search for: CloseAn icon of a letter X. President Folt\u2019s statement regarding situation in Israel and Gaza (10/10 update) Over the past several days, I have been in touch with many members of the Trojan Family who voiced their pain and despair in the wake of the unprecedented terrorist attacks in Israel. We mourn the shocking loss of life. We condemn the terrorist attacks by Hamas and their brutal threats to execute kidnapped civilians and commit other atrocities. As the horror in Israel and Gaza continues to unfold before our eyes, many of you have asked about how we are addressing the safety and well-being of our Trojan Family at USC. We immediately strengthened security protocols on our campuses and at places of worship. We just launched a new online source for accessing all available support services and updates. University resources and support will be open and operational throughout the fall break. The provost is working with faculty in all schools to provide academic accommodations for students who are struggling. Campus Support and Intervention and the Student Health Center continue to provide outreach and counseling services. We will provide additional support as needed. I have seen our Trojan community pull together with grace and humanity in these deeply disturbing times. During the dark days ahead, we need the light and compassion of our university community more than ever. Statement from 9:34 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 8: USC President Carol L. Folt released the following statement on Sunday: The grave events and the tragic loss of life taking place right now in Israel and Gaza fill us with such sadness. Our hearts go out to the millions of people there and to our own Trojan students, staff, faculty, families and alumni hurting and in fear for loved ones. We must \u2014 by working together with empathy and compassion \u2014 keep this anger and fear from harming and overwhelming our own community. Let\u2019s hold each other close and do all we can to support each other. Our university already is doubling down on providing support, resources and enhanced safety measures for our students, staff, faculty and members of our Trojan community. Campus Support and Intervention as well as campus counseling and mental health services are here and ready to help.

An integral part of USC\u2019s Frontiers of Computing initiative, ICT\u2019s labs and groups are pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in computing, embodying the spirit of USC\u2019s commitment to pioneering the future of technology. STORY AND VIDEO IN USC NEWS USC FRONTIERS OF COMPUTING Major Science and Technology Groups at ICT Select option to display slide Virtual Humans Affective Computing Vision and Graphics Simulation Mixed Reality Integration Environments Learning Sciences Body Computing Virtual Humans The ICT Virtual Human Toolkit is a set of tools and resources designed to help researchers and developers create realistic and engaging digital characters. Since 2009, this toolkit has been the foundation for all research at ICT on conversational AIs \u2014 computer programs that can interact with people like a human would. It has been used in various projects, including ELITE SHARP trainers and VITA. ICT Virtual Human Toolkit Affective Computing The Affective Computing Group focuses on understanding how emotions affect both human interactions and interactions between humans and machines. This includes studying how to automatically recognize emotions from different signals, creating computer models of how emotions develop and influence thinking, and applying these methods to improve teamwork between humans and machines, train people in social skills and expand knowledge about human emotions. Affective Computing Group Vision and Graphics Virtual characters are digital humans that can talk, move and interact, and they are important for entertainment, training and education. The main goal of the ICT Vision & Graphics Lab is to make these characters look as realistic as possible, including lighting them in a way that looks natural. To achieve this, the Vision & Graphics Lab uses its award-winning \u201cLight Stage\u201d technology, developed at ICT, to create high-quality visual details. The lab also works with major film companies like Sony Pictures Imageworks and WETA Digital. ICT Vision & Graphics Lab Simulation The Modeling and Simulation Group creates interactive and educational experiences to help train and support military personnel. They bring together researchers, experts, writers and game designers to make these experiences both interesting and useful. They\u2019ve successfully handed over several of their advanced training tools to the U.S. Department of Defense, including a disaster simulation program and various strategic training games for the Naval Postgraduate School. Modeling and Simulation Group Mixed Reality A cognitive architecture is a proposed model of how a mind works, whether in people or machines. It focuses on the basic structures needed to create intelligent behavior and how these structures work with knowledge and skills to handle various complex situations. The aim of this project is to create a smart system that can support virtual humans and possibly intelligent robots, and ideally, help us better understand human thinking. Cognitive Architecture Integration Environments Rapid Integration & Development Environment is a key research and development platform that speeds up the development of simulation technologies for the Department of Defense. It quickly creates and tests new ideas for the Army\u2019s Synthetic Training Environment and is now also used for various Navy and Air Force projects.

Campus Update May 5, 2024 Dear Trojan Family, I am writing to let you know that early this morning DPS, with the assistance of the LAPD, removed the occupiers who had rebuilt their illegal encampment in Alumni Park. The operation was peaceful. Campus is opening, students are returning to prepare for finals, and commencement set-up is in full swing. Over the last few weeks, the university exercised patience and restraint as we worked to de-escalate a volatile situation. We\u2019ve spoken to the occupiers daily, issued repeated warnings, and offered opportunities and locations for them to protest lawfully. We\u2019ve supported their right to express strong opinions and passions for their cause, as always. Yet when free speech protests devolve into illegal occupations, violating the rights of others, we must draw a line. The occupiers repeatedly chose to ignore university policies designed to benefit everyone, and to break the law. We needed to act quickly to protect the rights of our 80,000 students, staff, and faculty. We are in the critical period from the end-of-term quiet study week, through finals and our commencement ceremonies. Despite our efforts to de-escalate, the occupation was spiraling in a dangerous direction over the last several days. Areas of campus were blocked, people walking down Trousdale, our main thoroughfare, were harassed, and iconic Trojan symbols were defaced. In addition, university property was stolen, and commencement structures were dismantled. Residence halls, campus throughfares, and libraries had become places of confrontation. Some finals were disrupted with noise and chanting during mandated quiet periods. Yesterday afternoon, outside agitators jumped the perimeter fencing and assaulted our officers. This had to stop. With no resolution in sight, I requested the LAPD to assist DPS in removing the encampment as peacefully and safely as possible. At 4:10 a.m., an order to disperse was issued, providing the trespassers one last opportunity to leave voluntarily. In 64 minutes, the encampment was abandoned and cleared. The operation was peaceful with no arrests. We will not tolerate illegal encampments of any kind at USC. Over the last week, we methodically and carefully executed on our strategy. My goals were to prioritize safety and return our campus and our surrounding community to normalcy. We were determined to ensure our students could finish their exams without further disruption and that USC could host the commencement celebrations our graduates have worked hard to earn. As I shared with the Trojan Family last Friday, freedom of speech is central to who we are as a university and is at the core of our democratic society. USC is home to 47,000 students with many different perspectives, and our policies are designed in a manner that allows people to express those opinions. In closing, I thank DPS and the LAPD for their swift action, professionalism, and concern for our students. I also thank the Trojan community and our neighbors for your patience as we navigate these challenging times. Respectfully yours, Carol L.

It\u2019s a privilege to greet you on behalf of USC to the Western Region Summit on Antisemitism in Higher Education. Tomorrow marks one month since the horrific October 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas in Israel. I ask that we take a moment to remember family and loved ones who have been killed \u2013 and hold close all who have suffered, are still suffering, and are being held hostage right now. *** I\u2019m sure you remember the moment when you first learned of these horrendous terrorist attacks. For me, it was Saturday morning, after I had just celebrated a beautiful Shabbat dinner with Rabbi Dov Wagner, his wife Runya, and hundreds of students and their families. The shock was profound, and from that moment, like so many of you, all I could think of was how shattering it was to so many people. As president of USC, I immediately wanted to reach out to our community and campus leaders, to increase safety, ensure support for grieving and terrified students, faculty, and staff, and get everyone ready for what might be ahead. My team felt the same. We quickly activated and enhanced our special religious security forces, and began reaching out to our students, working with deans and faculty, increasing mental health services, talking to our boards and our legislative officials. And from that moment, we have not, nor will we, let up. We meet every day to prepare, share notes, improve, adjust, and do our best to help our community. And we want \u2013 indeed must \u2013 do even more. Being together with all of you to discuss antisemitism on our nation\u2019s campuses could not come at a more critical time. This summit is a beacon to help us face these profound issues with the urgency we feel, and at the very moment we need it most. *** I have many thank yous: starting with Hillel International, and the Jewish Federation for organizing us. Thank you to Adam Lehman, president and CEO of Hillel International; and to Rabbi Noah Farkas, president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles. I also want to thank the many Jewish leaders in LA and around the world who\u2019ve offered their counsel and support. And my special thanks to USC\u2019s Dean of Religious Life, Varun Soni, and Dave Cohn, executive director of USC Hillel, for helping to create and shape this important summit. *** In 2022, NYU hosted its Summit on Antisemitism. And USC was honored when asked to host this year\u2019s conference. Even then, we were seeing a troubling and unacceptable rise in antisemitism. And these incidences may have surged as much as 400 percent across the country (and on some college campuses) since the horrific terrorist attacks. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has reported that one-third of Jewish students experience antisemitism on their college campus each year. Clearly, we\u2019re facing a crisis. *** I speak regularly with our students and community members about their grief, anger, and fear. Please let me be clear: USC unequivocally denounces acts of antisemitism, discrimination, hate, and violence. But our communities want more than words, they want action. While much of the turmoil being reported elsewhere is not occurring at USC, we must work tirelessly to keep it that way. As an American university, the freedom to speak, to disagree, and even to peaceably protest is at the core of our academic mission. But freedom of expression should never be used as an excuse for sacrificing student safety. Academic freedom, safety, and well-being are not mutually exclusive. And it\u2019s up to all of us to foster learning environments where free inquiry and expression are protected, while at the same time being very clear as a community about our expectations for civil and respectful discourse. We have doubled down on our safety protocols \u2013 and work closely with our threat office and law enforcement. We\u2019re also working around the clock to listen to students and community members about their experiences. You\u2019re here because you, too, have been listening to your communities. *** In early 2022, I met with students at USC Hillel in the aftermath of several hateful social media posts rocking our community. They shared with me how they often experience expressions of anti-Zionism as antisemitism. We had a wonderful conversation about how USC could better support our Jewish students, and I took their advice. I convened our first Advisory Committee on Jewish Life, bringing together students, faculty, staff, Dave Cohn, Rabbi Dov, and many community members, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Jewish Federation of LA, the American Jewish Committee (AJC) and Academic Engagement Network (AEN), and of course, Hillel International, among others \u2013 all led by Dean Soni. I embraced all their recommendations, and work to complete them is underway. These are so powerful that I urge other universities to adopt them as well: To start, we added examples of antisemitism specifically to our required anti-discrimination training for new faculty, students, and staff. We also established a standing advisory committee to address emerging issues of antisemitism and support Jewish life. We\u2019re making accommodations for Jewish holidays, adding Kosher food, assessing our policies for political speech, and much more. *** My many visits with our Jewish community have taught me something I think many of you already know: how well our campuses persevere in challenging times is largely determined in the weeks, months, or even years before traumatic events like we\u2019re now experiencing. Trust is determined by a legacy of support and listening, by making services available, and by taking action. While certainly not perfect, USC has a long history of taking action, and I\u2019d like to take a minute to point out a few that might be relevant to the conversations ahead. First, USC has a strong, vibrant community of more than 4,000 Jewish students and importantly, a 50-year history of excellent academic programs in Jewish studies. And we just signed an agreement with Hebrew Union College for another 25 years of shared education in Jewish history, culture, and traditions. Second, our students also have incredible support through the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life, and in Hillel and Chabad. Just a few weeks ago, Rabbi Dov and Runya hosted \u201cShabbat 1000.\u201d It began back in 2007 as \u201cShabbat 300\u201d \u2013 with the goal of hosting 300 students. As you can guess, more than 1,200 students attended the most recent dinner \u2013 it\u2019s so well-attended now, they have to hold it outside on Severance Street, just a few blocks from UPC! Third, USC supports vitally important global research centers in Jewish history and contemporary culture, including: The Shoah Foundation, under Director Rob Williams, which joined the USC community almost 20 years ago and catalogues approximately 55,000 Holocaust testimonies. The Casden Institute for the Study of the Jewish Role in American Life, founded in 1998, under Director and Distinguished Professor Steve Ross. And the Center for Advanced Genocide Research, established in 2014, under its founding director, Dr. Wolf Gruner. And fourth, we also have a recent history of acting to correct wrongs, like when we removed the names of Rufus von KleinSmid from an iconic USC building, and Dean Cromwell from our Track & Field facility, because of their history of antisemitism and racial prejudice. *** I believe the world needs its great universities to reject antisemitism, foster understanding, and reject hate, intolerance, and all forms of prejudice. And we need our educators to communicate values \u2013 and act on them \u2013 to ensure our students, faculty, and staff are safe, welcomed, and supported. Antisemitism is a global crisis. We must work together to combat it. It\u2019s my honor to be here, and I thank you for entrusting USC to host this important event. *** Finally, I would like to invite you to take a photo of the QR code you see behind me. This will lead you to USC\u2019s \u201cNetwork of Informational and Support Resources in Times of Conflict.\u201d Here, you\u2019ll find the most up-to-date resources, reassurances, and answers \u2013 with the aim to help you navigate life on our campuses during these times.

For reservations and more information, visit: https://dps.usc.edu/services/shuttles/. 10 Freeway Section Closure (posted 11/12) Due to a massive storage yard fire below the 10 freeway on Saturday that caused damage to the supporting structure, the 10 freeway will be FULLY CLOSED until further notice between the East LA Connector and Alameda Street (see map below). While there is no direct impact to campus or our bus routes, the closure of this section of freeway will increase congestion and cause traffic delays on all surface streets in the area of the closure as motorists navigate the closed section of freeway. We anticipate the heaviest impacts will be on the 110 North and South and the 101 East and West, as this is the alternate freeway route, and on surface streets in the East Los Angeles area south of Union Station. Please avoid the impacted area and plan for delays due to congestion. If possible for your commute, this might be a great time to try Metro; the light rail can take you from points all over Los Angeles to the University Park Campus using connectors that get you to the Expo (E) Line, and three campus-adjacent stations. Visit the trip planner online at www.metro.net to learn more. Please be sure to save and submit any public transit receipts to tsubsidy@usc.edu for 50% reimbursement under USC\u2019s Transit Subsidy program. Please contact USC Transportation via email at auxtrans@usc.edu if you have any questions regarding this closure. https://transnet.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CALTRANS-announcement.jpg UPC Area Congestion on Tuesday, November 7 (posted (11/3) On Tuesday, November 7, a crane lift in Exposition Park related to the Endeavor project is anticipated to draw media and spectator congestion to the City streets and areas surrounding the Coliseum between the hours of 7:00am-noon.

If you are interested in seeing the crane lift activity, the area in green on this map (on the top level of the parking structure on site) has been identified as the best public viewing area.

DPS Reminder Regarding USC Village Access (posted 7/15/2022) Given the importance of creating a safe environment at the USC Village for our students, faculty, staff, and USC Village visitors, the USC Department of Public Safety developed the following rules concerning open access, vehicular traffic, and pedestrian right-of-way. We believe these rules will also help alleviate any congestion that may be created by cars, electric carts, bicycles, skateboards, URB-E\u2019s, hover boards, delivery trucks, maintenance, and construction vehicles at this location. Please see the reminders below, in addition to this map of the USC Village dismount zone. Area A (central quad) No cars, electric carts, bicycles, skateboards, URB-E\u2019s, hover boards, Uber or Lyft vehicles, delivery trucks, or construction vehicles will be allowed to drive or park in the central common area, or in front of any building as it faces the inner, central common area, except: Emergency vehicles FMS electric carts for groundskeepers, USC Mail and Material Management Services Vehicles delivering mail (no FedEx, UPS or other outside carriers) Human-powered pallet jacks and hand carts used for retail product delivery from commercial vehicle parking areas behind Buildings UVF/MHC and UVN/CRC. Any vehicle traffic in this area must stay on cement paved lanes and not travel over grass, paver planting, tree beds or grass and be mindful of pedestrian right of way. Area B (north of UVF/MHC, west of UVN/CRC) Delivery vehicle access will only be allowed at the McClintock and Hoover service gate entrances, and only between the hours of 7:00am and 9:00pm. Delivery vehicles on the service lanes north of UVF/MHC must park outside of the fire lane and be attended to at all times. Delivery vehicles must not park in the service lane running north / south adjacent to UVN/CRC. Delivery vehicles that park in fire lanes or are left unattended for extended lengths of time will be cited or towed. There will be a 30 minute time limit on all delivery vehicle parking, even in the appropriate areas. Contractor or Maintenance vendor vehicles are only allowed in the service lanes to facilitate deliveries. No construction contractor parking is allowed. Maintenance vendor vehicles may at times park on the service lane north of UVF/MHC and will be required to display vendor parking passes to be provided by the USC department managing their service (i.e. USC Housing, USC Hospitality, USC Real Estate, USC FMS). Pedestrian pickups and drop-offs may only stop outside the public sidewalk perimeter of the Village. Uber and Lyft vehicles should not pull into the underground garage entry ramp and then stop/perform U-turns, as this creates a hazard. Loading and unloading of party/event equipment rentals may only occur via the McClintock entrance behind UVF/MHC. USC Housing, USC Hospitality and USC Mailing Services vehicles must park in the designated spaces behind UVF/MHC. USC FMS and DPS Vehicles must park in the designated areas north of UVN/CRC and adjacent to UVO. All other USC vehicles and electric carts will be cited or towed. Visitors to the USC Village should be using appropriate parking in the underground retail parking garage. Overall No fire lanes may be blocked at any time. Rate Increase announcement (originally posted 5/9/2022) Beginning July 1, 2022, the university will introduce adjusted rates for parking permits. The adjustment follows a five-year period during which permit fees remained unchanged, as well as a period during the height of the pandemic, where fees were altogether suspended. The maintenance of the university\u2019s parking facilities is supported by the revenue generated by parking permit fees, and the increases in operational expense have created the need to raise the price of permits. The new price for parking permits in the Gold parking tier, which accounts for a majority of permits, will be $115/month (from $111/month). Similar increases averaging 5% will be implemented for all parking permits; a full rate schedule can be found on the USC Transportation Parking Rates webpage. Fees for daily guest parking ($20/day), short-term hourly parking ($4/hr) are also being increased as of July 1; for full details about short-term parking options, please refer to our Daily and Hourly Parking webpage. These increases are necessary to support the ongoing operations of our department as we return our services to pre-COVID levels. The two- and three-day employee parking permits, which were introduced to support hybrid working schedules, will continue to be offered in FY23, providing a lower-cost permit option for people coming to campus on a part-time basis. Additional cost-effective parking alternatives include UPC\u2019s Grand Avenue Parking Structure and HSC\u2019s Lot 71 and Valley Lot, which will remain in our lower Cardinal pricing tier at $85/month (from $81/month), and various Pay-By-Plate locations available for short-term campus visits. Alternatives to campus parking include our public transit program, which is subsidized 50% by USC, and carpooling. These options can be explored using our online transit portal, Traveler. Thank you in advance for your support, and please let us know if you have any questions. Independence Day Service Hours (posted 6/24/2022) Monday, July 4, is Independence Day, an official USC Holiday.

Additional Downey Entrance/Structure Impacts (posted 6/3/2022) The Downey Entrance at UPC has been impacted by the construction of Ginsburg Hall in recent months; we were notified today that the project will be impacting the entrance from Vermont, and the north structure entrance, even further in the coming weeks. Please see below and this attachment for details. ENTRANCE IMPACT Beginning Tuesday, June 7, the Downey Entrance/Exit to campus will be COMPLETELY CLOSED until further notice. To enter the southwest quadrant of campus, please use either the Watt Way Entrance (open weekdays only from 6:00am-9:00pm), or the McClintock Entrance (24 hrs). Both those same points can be used for egress (please drive towards the Watt Way exit slowly if the vehicle gate is closed, it will automatically swing inwards). We expect the temporary loss of the Downey Entrance will create additional area traffic, especially in the morning and evening rush hours; please use caution and give yourself extra time if possible. STRUCTURE IMPACT From June 7 \u2013 July 17, the north exit from the Downey Structure will still be available, as an EXIT ONLY, and can be used to take Downey Way back to McClintock (one-way traffic only), from which either of the exit points above can be used. Between July 18 \u2013 August 5, this exit will no longer be available, and the ONLY exit from the Downey Structure will be the east exit onto McClintock Avenue. We anticipate this will create significant delays and congestion within the structure, especially during the evening rush hour; please be patient and cooperative with your fellow commuters during this time. Thank you in advance for your cooperation; please let us know if you have any questions. Downtown L.A. Street Closures, June 6-10 (posted 6/3/2022) The City of Los Angeles is privileged to host the Ninth Summit of the Americas from June 6-10, a gathering expected to include world leaders from throughout North, Central, and South America, as well as the Caribbean.

While we have not been advised of any LADOT street closures, the five major streets surrounding campus/the Coliseum (Martin Luther King Blvd., Exposition Blvd., Jefferson Blvd., Figueroa St. and Vermont Ave.) will be extremely congested on Saturday, with related congestion impacting smaller streets feeding towards campus, and both directions of the 110/10 freeways (especially the Vermont/Hoover exits off the 10, and Exposition/MLK exits off the 110). Please also note that due to area construction impacts, the Downey Entrance on Vermont Avenue adjacent to the Downey Structure (formerly PSA) will convert to an EXIT ONLY at 1:00pm.

If you have not received an invitation to join the program by January 10, please email us at auxtrans@usc.edu. There are USC Lyft Ride changes which will go into effect on January 10. Listed below are the new program guidelines: The new program optimizes rides by pairing up to two riders from the program going to similar locations. Riders will choose the USC Lyft Ride \u2013 SHARED option as their mode of travel in the app. All ride requests must be for single individuals only. Friends traveling together must make individual requests for rides using the app, even if they are going to/from the same location. Masks are required to be worn at all times, the front seat and middle seat must be kept empty, and eating and drinking are not allowed during rides. If anyone in the vehicle is not following these guidelines, BOTH riders and drivers have the ability to cancel the ride without penalty and report issues they experienced directly to Lyft. Spring Permits Available this Friday, Dec. 3 (posted 11/29/21) Parking permits for the Spring 2022 semester will go live on our website this Friday, Dec. 3, at noon. PLEASE NOTE: All Fall Student permits renew for Spring automatically; the only capacity created for Spring sales comes from returned permits due to permit cancellations, or from Fall graduates (if you\u2019re graduating and no longer need your permit, please remember to return it to us, otherwise, we won\u2019t know!) After noon on Friday, all currently available options for Spring will be listed in your account through our website at www.usc.edu/transportation; if the location you want is not listed, unfortunately, that means it is sold out or remains otherwise unavailable.

The recent events at USC have been hard on all of us \u2013 I know you\u2019re seeing it, hearing it, and that you have many questions about how we\u2019re maintaining safety, honoring free speech, and ensuring we can host our 141st commencement to give our graduates the celebration they have earned. We\u2019re working hard to maintain a peaceful campus. The situation is fluid \u2013 like at other universities across the nation \u2013 and we will adapt when necessary. We\u2019re also seeing a lot on social media that\u2019s distorted and, in many cases, is outright misinformation. I want to share what our university is doing right now: We\u2019re getting ready for 47 commencement ceremonies and celebrations. When you walk across campus, you\u2019ll see stages, tents, and chairs going up \u2013 cardinal and gold banners and flowers everywhere. USC traditions are holding strong. I walked by Tommy Trojan today and witnessed graduates and their families lining up at our campus icons, taking photos and commemorating this important event. I encourage you to click on Tommy Cam to see that the Trojan Spirit is in full swing. We\u2019re also deep into Quiet Week with final exams approaching \u2013 students are filling our libraries, meeting in study groups, and even taking an occasional break for coffee with friends. They\u2019re focused on academic achievement, and it\u2019s our job to support them in every way possible, including academic accommodations if needed. We\u2019re maintaining our unshakeable commitment to free speech, with a designated Free Speech Area for peaceful protests and USC\u2019s balanced, robust, and independent student-run media reporting on campus every day. This is part of our commitment to allow all students to access and move around our campuses free from obstruction, harassment, threats, or discrimination. And we will continue to ensure the physical safety and well-being of every Trojan on our campuses. I\u2019m talking directly with our students, including two lengthy sessions with representatives from Divest from Death USC, the group that established the encampment in Alumni Park. In addition, we\u2019re holding informational sessions with our faculty and staff. And I will continue the important outreach to all members of our community \u2013 including our Jewish and Israeli communities, our Palestinian and Muslim communities, as well as others. I have faith in our ability to unite and seek common ground. My call to action is to ask for your help: de-escalate tension, keep our campuses peaceful, respect our 47,000 students \u2013 and, whenever you can, remember to congratulate the members of the Class of 2024 on their outstanding accomplishments.

The University of Southern California believes in the core principle of academic freedom, and has a longstanding position against such boycotts on the grounds that a robust intellectual environment requires the free and civil exchange of ideas.

Campus Update May 3, 2024 Dear Trojan Family, I\u2019m writing to let you know the steps we\u2019re taking now to ensure students finish their finals in a quiet, safe academic environment \u2013 and that our graduating students can enjoy peaceful and joyous commencement ceremonies worthy of their accomplishments. Freedom of expression is one of our foundational values, and throughout the year, faculty, staff, and students have held lawful marches, vigils, and peaceful demonstrations. But let me be absolutely clear: free speech and assembly do not include the right to obstruct equal access to campus, damage property, or foment harassment, violence, and threats. Nor is anyone entitled to obstruct the normal functions of our university, including commencement. The university is legally obligated to ensure that students, faculty, and staff can move freely throughout our campus while pursuing their studies, work, and research. Every part of our campuses, including Alumni Park, must be fully accessible and free from vandalism and harassment. When laws and policies that apply to everyone are repeatedly and flagrantly violated \u2013 there must be consequences. This is an intense and highly charged time for the country and for many here at USC \u2013 I\u2019m asking everyone to help, abide by all our security measures, and treat each other with empathy and respect. The university has initiated disciplinary review processes for individuals who have violated both our policies and the law. We will take any further actions required to maintain campus safety and security, consistent with our legal obligations. Finals conclude on Wednesday and our commencement ceremonies begin that same day. We\u2019re quickly approaching the time when our graduates, their families, and loved ones will come together at USC. I\u2019m grateful to everyone who is working so tirelessly to bring USC\u2019s commencement celebrations to life. With gratitude, Carol L.

Home Background Fossil Fuels FAQs Meetings Submissions Membership News More\u2026Show More Menu SearchAn icon of a magnifying glass. Search for: CloseAn icon of a letter X. Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility About The Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility (ACIR) was formed to advise the Investment Committee of the Board of Trustees on matters relating to environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) as expressed by the broader USC community. Topics considered by the ACIR include, but are not limited to, environmental sustainability, diversity equity and inclusion, corporate governance, and human rights issues that are relevant to investing. The ACIR provides advice about responsible investment practices to the Investment Committee, but it does not manage USC\u2019s Endowment Fund or its investments in any way. The Investment Committee ultimately determines whether to accept or reject the ACIR\u2019s proposed recommendations. The ACIR was endorsed by the Investment Committee of the Board of Trustees on November 22, 2021 and formally established by the Board of Trustees on July 19, 2022. It operates under the oversight of the Office of the President, the President approves all members and selects the committee chairperson. The ACIR Charter governs the role and responsibilities of the ACIR. Mission The central mission of the University of Southern California is the development of human beings and society as a whole through the cultivation and enrichment of the human mind and spirit. The principal means by which our mission is accomplished are teaching, research, artistic creation, professional practice and selected forms of public service. USC\u2019s Endowment Fund provides vital financial support to the University to ensure our academic and research missions may endure in perpetuity for current and future students. The primary investment objective for the Endowment Fund is to maximize long-term returns on investment assets that are compatible with the University\u2019s risk tolerance and time horizon, and consistent with prudent investment practices. The Board of Trustees recognizes the importance of stewardship criteria in safeguarding and promoting the endowment\u2019s long-term economic interests. ESG factors may impact future economic growth and the underlying fabric of a society. While specific issues will vary by asset class and investment strategy, USC recognizes that ESG factors can meaningfully influence the outcome of the USC\u2019s investment portfolio. In addition to the Investment Policy Statement, the USC Investment Office also operates under the guidance of its Investment Stewardship Policy. The consideration of these factors in the investment process is consistent with USC\u2019s mission and unifying values.

Search for: CloseAn icon of a letter X. Update on Campus Hate Speech and New Government Actions Regarding Antisemitism and Islamophobia October 31, 2023 Dear Students, Faculty and Staff: Over the past three weeks, we\u2019ve been in conversation with many faculty, students, staff, alumni, and parents who have been personally and profoundly impacted by the violence in Israel and Gaza. Yesterday, the federal government announced new actions to address antisemitism and Islamophobia on college campuses. The White House, the Department of Education (DOE), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will be issuing formal guidelines. Here is what we know so far: The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) will be updating its discrimination complaint form to include language stating that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits antisemitism and Islamophobia and will expedite investigations of these complaints. DOE is also planning to hold technical assistance webinars to provide students with information on how to file an OCR complaint. The DOJ and DHS are dedicating 125 protective security advisers and 100 cybersecurity advisers to proactively work with schools and universities to address their needs for cyber threats and online harassment. The Justice Department\u2019s Community Relations Service is also expanding support for Jewish, Muslim, Arab and other impacted communities on campuses across the nation. US Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution denouncing antisemitism at institutions of higher education and encourages college and university leaders, administrators to voice their opposition to antisemitism on campus. At a time when antisemitism has accelerated across the country and around the world, our Jewish and Israeli communities have expressed concerns about protest and poster policies on campus, and about the rhetoric they encounter online and in the classroom. Many are afraid for their safety. And as reports of Islamophobia are increasing, our Muslim, Palestinian, and Arab communities have expressed fear about being doxed, targeted, and harassed online, and about being censored and canceled for their advocacy on campus. USC publicly and unequivocally denounces antisemitism, Islamophobia, racism, and xenophobia. Hate speech is antithetical to our values and any threats of violence are unacceptable. Anyone who incites violence will be referred immediately to law enforcement for investigation and prosecution. We have a dedicated page that outlines in detail USC\u2019s policies on campus safety including specific rules, procedures, support resources and our values. We update this frequently and urge you to use it and refers others to it as needed. During this time of immense pain and intense polarization, it is more important than ever for us to model what civil disagreement and respectful debate looks like on campuses, in our classrooms, and online. Indeed, our university community can and should be a sanctuary for critical thinking and civic engagement so that we can all be part of the solution to the world\u2019s most challenging problems. And so, we ask all members of our community to continue to see the humanity in each other, to recognize and respect each other\u2019s value and dignity, and to treat each other as cherished members of a global Trojan Family.
